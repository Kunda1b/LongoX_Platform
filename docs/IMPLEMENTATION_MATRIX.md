## Workflow Engine — §9

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DAG execution (topological sort, parallel fan-out) | ✅ | |
| Bounded loops (maxIterations, breakOnKey, continueCondition) | ✅ | `DAGRunner.executeBoundedLoop()` |

| Utility nodes (Delay, Log, Annotate, Notify, Debug) | ❌ | Not registered in `services/execution-service/src/executors/registry.ts` |
| Saga compensation (LIFO) | ✅ | `SagaCoordinator` wired via `sagaStack` in `DAGRunner`; `runSagaCompensation()` called in `finally` block |
| `compensation_status` in checkpoint DB schema | ❌ | Runtime records it in `dag-worker.ts:311,389`; `NodeExecutionCheckpoint` in `schema.prisma` still lacks the column |
| Human approval pause/resume | ✅ | Writes to `approval_tasks`; pauses and resumes on signal |
| Approval escalation chain + reminders (24h/1h) | ✅ | `startApprovalTimeoutSweeper()` in `packages/workflow-engine/src/approval.ts`; 24h (lines 182-194) and 1h (lines 196-208) reminders; escalation at lines 210-237 |
| Child workflows — fire-and-forget | ✅ | `spawnChildWorkflow`; `parentExecutionId` correlation |
| Child workflows — sync (`await: true`) | ✅ | `awaitChildWorkflowCompletion()` wired in `dag-worker.ts:759-763` |
| Child workflow nesting depth cap (5) | ✅ | Enforced in `dag-runner.ts:387-411`; defaults to 5 |
| Checkpoint schema — §9.7 complete fields | ❌ | `NodeExecutionCheckpoint` in `schema.prisma` still missing: `idempotency_key`, `compensation_status`, `retry_count`, `started_at`, `finished_at` — only `stateJson` blob stored |
| Idempotency key: `workflow_id + run_id + node_id + attempt` | ❌ | `IdempotencyStore` uses `executionId` only; composite format not implemented |
| Node lease (acquire/renew 60s/expire 5min) using `execution_leases` | ❌ | `execution_leases` table exists; `InMemoryLeaseStore`/`RedisLeaseStore` exist in `workflow-engine` package; not wired in `dag-worker.ts` |
| 3-attempt recovery → `recovery_exhausted` DLQ | ✅ | `dag-worker.ts:652-700`; explicit `recovery_exhausted` terminal status; DLQ routing and `execution.recovery_exhausted` event emitted |

| `audit-export` queue | ✅ | Redis DB 9; RDB-only |
| `ai-run` / `longox:ai-evaluation` queue | 🟡 | `ai-run` queue exists; §11 specifies `longox:ai-evaluation` — naming mismatch |
| `longox:search-indexing` queue | ❌ | Not found; no search indexing queue in topology |
| `longox:maintenance` queue (low priority) | ❌ | Not found |
| Queue name `longox:` namespace prefix | 🟡 | §11 specifies `longox:` prefix; all new queues omit it; only legacy shim uses `longox:executions` |
| Redis cluster (3 primary + 3 replica) | 🟡 | Terraform: `cluster_mode_enabled=true`, 3 shards × 1 replica — correct topology; Helm `global.yaml` has no explicit `cluster.enabled` flag, relies on external connection string |
| Per-queue AOF/RDB persistence tuning | ✅ | `AofMode` enum per queue: every-write / every-second / rdb-only |
| Control-plane / execution-plane queue separation | 🟡 | Isolated by Redis logical DB index (0–9); not physically separate cluster pools |
| BullMQ DLQ with `/dlq/:id/retry` redrive | 🟡 | `DeadLetterQueue` class and redrive exist; endpoint is `/executions/:id/retry` (not `/dlq/:id/retry`) — path mismatch with spec |
| Legacy `longox:executions` shim retired | ❌ | `LEGACY_QUEUE_NAME = "longox:executions"` preserved in `bullmq-queue.ts` for backwards compatibility |

---

## Realtime — ADR-008

| Dashboard refresh SSE | ✅ | `dashboard-service/src/api/dashboard-stream-route.ts` — SSE endpoint implemented |
| Notification center SSE | ✅ | `notification-service/src/api/rest/notification-stream.ts` — SSE endpoint implemented |
| Single multiplexed SSE connection (demux by `event_type`) | ✅ | `GET /api/v1/realtime` in `api-gateway/src/routes/execution-stream.ts:413-647`; demuxes execution, dashboard, notification surfaces by `event_type`; subscribes via `?event_types=&executionIds=&dashboardIds=&recipientId=` |
| `packages/shared-realtime` — RealtimeHub | ✅ | `RealtimeHub` class manages `SseClient` registrations and broadcasts; `redis-execution-bus.ts` provides cross-instance Redis pub/sub fan-out |
| Bearer token auth on SSE | ✅ | `authorize("executions:read")` middleware on stream endpoint |
| `EventSource` — `Authorization` header workaround | 🟡 | Server-side uses standard `text/event-stream`; client-side `fetch+ReadableStream` polyfill presence not confirmed in audit |
| AI streaming SSE | ✅ | Detects `accept: text/event-stream`; AI response delivered via SSE |
| AI partial response checkpoint every ~1s | ❌ | Not implemented in `AiExecutor`; returns single result on completion |
| Backpressure handling | ❌ | No buffer-and-close logic for slow clients; `res.write()` return value unchecked |

---

## Connector Sandbox — ADR-009

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Deno isolate per connector invocation | 🟡 | `DenoIsolate` class in `packages/connector-sandbox` |
| In-process V8 isolate (`deno_core` binding, no IPC) | ❌ | `deno-bridge.ts:57` uses `node:child_process.execFile` to launch Deno subprocess — not an embedded in-process isolate |
| Sub-ms cold-start | ❌ | Process fork latency exceeds target; not benchmarked or validated |
| Resource caps (CPU, memory, wall-clock) | ✅ | Enforced via Deno CLI flags |
| Network: only allow-listed fetch | ✅ | `--allow-net` with domain allow-list |
| Sigstore signing at install time | ✅ | Present in connector manifests; verified in `install-connector.command.ts` |
| Sigstore re-verification at cold-start | 🟡 | Install-time verification confirmed; cold-start re-verification not wired in `connector-sandbox` or `sandbox-runtime` |
| Marketplace lifecycle (install, configure, upgrade, remove) | ✅ | |

---

## Search — ADR-010

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL FTS as primary backend | 🟡 | `PostgresSearchRepository` exists using `ts_rank`/`ts_query` |
| Generated `tsvector` columns queried (not runtime `to_tsvector()`) | ❌ | All entity queries (workflows, apps, templates, connectors, executions, audit logs, AI prompts) still call `to_tsvector()` at runtime; `SearchIndex.titleTsv`/`contentTsv` columns exist but are not used by the repository |
| GIN indexes utilized | 🟡 | Defined in SQL migration `002_search_fts_indexes.sql`; not utilized because runtime queries bypass pre-computed columns |
| `SearchService.search(domain, query, filters)` abstraction | ✅ | `SearchRepository` interface with swappable implementations |
| OpenSearch escape path | ❌ | Not implemented as runtime fallback; comment in `infrastructure/index.ts` only |

| Token accounting — `cached_tokens`, `tool_call_tokens` | 🟡 | Tracked in `ai-service/src/application/services/token-accounting.service.ts`; not consumed as separate dimensions in `metering-service` domain entity |
| Input guardrails | ✅ | `AiRunLifecycleService` |
| Input guardrails on streaming path | ✅ | `api/ai-runs-route.ts:102-162` — `moderationService.moderateInput()` executes before SSE stream opens; returns 403 if blocked |
| Output guardrails | ✅ | `AiRunLifecycleService` |
| Tool guardrails (allow-list for model-emitted tool calls) | ✅ | `ai-run-lifecycle.service.ts:267-292` — checks `allowedTools` against model tool calls; blocks on violation |
| Per-workflow token ceiling (default 100K) | ❌ | `cost-budget.service.ts` handles financial budgets (USD) only; no per-workflow token count ceiling enforced in request lifecycle |
| RAG (pgvector + cosine similarity) | ✅ | `VectorSearchService` with `<=>` operator; chunking pipeline |
| AI evaluation framework | ✅ | `EvaluationService`, `RegressionGateService`; `ai_eval_datasets` and `ai_eval_runs` tables |
| Eval CI gate blocking production promotion | 🟡 | `eval-gate` blocks `build-images` in `ci.yml:270`; NOT referenced in `cd.yml` as a deployment gate |

| All 9 metered dimensions | 🟡 | `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cost` tracked; `cached_tokens` and `tool_call_tokens` not consumed as separate dimensions in `metering-service` domain (`metering-event.ts` only defines `ai.token` and `ai.completion`) |
| Hourly rollup job | ✅ | `billing-rollup` queue + `rollup-job.ts`; `BillingRollupJobData` defined |
| Daily reconciliation job | ✅ | `billing-reconciliation` queue + `reconciliation-job.ts`; `ReconciliationService.runDailyReconciliation()` wired |
| Invoices generated from rollups only | ✅ | Invoice traceability chain present |
| Token budgets — 50%/80%/100% thresholds | ✅ | Budget alerts in `billing-service` |
| Token budget — AI hard cutoff (`hard_cutoff_at`) | ✅ | AI fails; non-AI continues |
| `monthly_limit` naming alignment | 🟡 | `cost-budget.service.ts` removed; `billing.entity.ts` uses `budgetLimit`; schema column is `monthly_limit` — naming inconsistent across layers |
| Plan entitlements enforcement | ✅ | `EntitlementService` + `entitlement-guard.ts` middleware |
| Monthly partitioning DDL on `metering_events` | ✅ | Confirmed in `packages/shared-db/migrations/006_partition_high_volume_tables.sql` |

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PlatformEvent` — all 10 mandatory fields | ✅ | |
| `event_id` with `evt_` prefix (mandatory) | ✅ | `createEvent()` line 129: `` const id = `evt_${randomUUID()}` `` — prefix now mandatory |
| `validateEvent` — `evt_` prefix strictly enforced | 🟡 | Regex at line 196 enforces `evt_` prefix; error message at line 207 incorrectly says "optionally prefixed" — cosmetic inconsistency only |
| `tenant_id` with `tnt_` prefix enforced | 🟡 | `validateEvent()` enforces via regex; `createEvent()` constructor does not enforce |
| `actor_id` with `usr_` prefix enforced | 🟡 | `validateEvent()` enforces; `createEvent()` constructor does not enforce |
| All 16 event types from §19.4 implemented | 🟡 | Event handlers present for all 16 types; `billing.usage.recorded` naming violation remains (see row below) |
| `workflow.rolled_back` event name (underscore) | ✅ | Underscore confirmed in `PlatformEventType` |
| `usage.recorded` vs `billing.usage.recorded` | ❌ | `packages/shared-gateway/src/projections/reporting-projection.ts:49` uses `billing.usage.recorded`; §19.4 specifies `usage.recorded` |
| JSON Schema files at `packages/shared-types/schemas/events/` | ✅ | All 16 present |
| `consumer_offsets` auto-deduplication in EventBus | ❌ | `packages/event-bus/src/index.ts` is a placeholder; `InMemoryEventBus`, `RedisEventBus`, `NatsEventBus` do not interact with `consumer_offsets` |

## Open Gaps Summary

Remaining items after 2026-07-05 import. Matrix tables above are the authoritative per-row status. The lists below de-duplicate cross-section gaps (AI 1s checkpoint in Workflow Engine §9 and Realtime ADR-008; Redis cluster Helm in Queue Topology §11 and Infrastructure) and exclude 3 Frontend 🟡 rows (design system migration, dashboard grid library, app surface population) as product-completeness items outside architecture compliance scope. Net unique architecture compliance gaps: **32 ❌ + 31 🟡 = 63**.

### ❌ — Not Implemented (32 items)

| # | Gap | Section |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `NodeExecutionCheckpoint` in `schema.prisma` missing §9.7 columns (`idempotency_key`, `compensation_status`, `retry_count`, `started_at`, `finished_at`); runtime code writes `compensation_status` in `dag-worker.ts` but the DB column does not exist | §9.7 |
| 2 | Utility nodes (Delay, Log, Annotate, Notify, Debug) not registered in executor registry | §9.10 |
| 3 | Idempotency key format (`workflow_id+run_id+node_id+attempt`): `IdempotencyStore` uses `executionId` only | §9 |
| 4 | Node lease (`execution_leases` table) not wired into `dag-worker.ts` | §9 |
| 5 | Per-workflow 100K token ceiling not enforced in AI request lifecycle | §8.10 |
| 6 | AI streaming checkpoint every ~1s not implemented | §8 / ADR-008 |
| 7 | `longox:search-indexing` queue missing from topology | §11 |

### 🟡 — Partially Implemented (31 items)

| # | Gap | Section |
|---|---|---|
| 33 | Unit & contract tests — not all services have test suites | §21.3 |
| 34 | Trivy runs `--scanType fs`; container image scan needed | §21.3 |
| 35 | Progressive staging: 50% canary step missing (10% → 100% jump) | §21.3 |
| 36 | Production approval gate: `environment: production` gating present; 1-vs-2 approver tier logic absent | §21.3 |
| 37 | Rollback target verification: `rollout undo` present; no health check of rollback target | §21.3 |
| 38 | AI eval gate: blocks `build-images` in `ci.yml`; NOT wired as blocking deployment gate in `cd.yml` | §21.3 / §8.8 |
| 39 | GraphQL schema per service: `workflow-service` ✅; `auth-service`, `execution-service` missing | §24.2 |
| 40 | OpenAPI spec per service: `workflow-service` ✅; `auth-service`, `execution-service` missing | §24.2 |
| 41 | Zod request schemas: 30+ endpoints covered; not all routes wired | API Contracts |
| 42 | Partial indexes (`WHERE status='active'`): not expressible in Prisma DSL; raw SQL migrations unconfirmed | §10 |
| 43 | `tsvector` columns in core domain tables (Workflow, NodeExecution): missing; only `SearchIndex` has them | ADR-010 |
| 44 | `packages/shared-testing`: package exists but `src/index.ts` is a placeholder comment only | §24.1 |
| 45 | `packages/event-bus`: package exists but `src/index.ts` is a placeholder comment only | §24.1 |
| 46 | `execution-service` internal structure: uses hybrid `runners/orchestrator/executors/queue/` — not strict `domain/application/infrastructure/api/` | §24.2 |
| 47 | Kong Express shim still active entry point; Kong config ready but not in production traffic path | ADR-006 |
| 48 | All 8 node executor families: 8 families registered; utility sub-nodes (Delay, Log, etc.) absent | §9 |
| 49 | `ai-run` queue naming: queue exists but §11 specifies `longox:ai-evaluation`; `longox:` namespace prefix absent from all new queues | §11 |
| 50 | Redis cluster: Terraform correctly configured (3+3); Helm `global.yaml` lacks explicit `cluster.enabled` flag | §11.2 |
| 51 | Control-plane / execution-plane queue separation: logically separated by Redis DB index; not physically separate cluster pools | §11 |
| 52 | DLQ redrive endpoint: `/executions/:id/retry` exists but §11 specifies `/dlq/:id/retry` | §11 |
| 53 | `EventSource` auth workaround: server-side standard SSE confirmed; client-side `fetch+ReadableStream` polyfill not confirmed in audit | ADR-008 |
| 54 | Sigstore re-verification at cold-start: install-time ✅; sandbox boot re-verification not wired | ADR-009 |
| 55 | GIN indexes: defined in `002_search_fts_indexes.sql`; bypassed because queries still call runtime `to_tsvector()` | ADR-010 |
| 56 | `cached_tokens`/`tool_call_tokens`: tracked in `ai-service`; not consumed as separate dimensions in `metering-service` domain | §16.1 |
| 57 | `monthly_limit` naming: `cost-budget.service.ts` removed; `billing.entity.ts` uses `budgetLimit`; schema column is `monthly_limit` — still inconsistent | §16 |
| 58 | `validateEvent` error message says "optionally prefixed with evt_" despite regex enforcing it — cosmetic inconsistency | §19.1 |
| 59 | `tenant_id` / `actor_id` prefixes: `validateEvent()` enforces; `createEvent()` constructor does not | §19.1 |
| 60 | All 16 event types: handlers present; `billing.usage.recorded` naming violation (see item 15) means §19.4 not fully satisfied | §19.4 |
| 61 | `AsyncLocalStorage` for `tenant_id`: `shared-logger` still falls back to `globalThis.__longoxTenantId` | §22 |
| 62 | OTel search-service: metrics instrumentation present; distributed tracing (tracer/spans) not initialized | §22 |
| 63 | PodDisruptionBudgets: Helm chart templates include PDB; raw `infrastructure/kubernetes/` manifests not confirmed | §22 |

## Fix History

| Date | Changes |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-03 (batch 1) | API v1 deprecation, tenant tier column, FTS SQL injection (parameterized queries), SSE Redis fanout, RBAC promote action, dashboard redirect. **Partial:** in-memory + Redis `LeaseStore` classes added to `workflow-engine` package but `execution_leases` DB table not yet wired into `dag-worker` (remains ❌ in matrix). |
| 2026-07-03 (batch 2) | pgvector HNSW index, VectorSearchService, GDPR S3/cascade deletion, cold query Parquet/presigned URLs, multi-tenancy tier routing, entitlements guard middleware, Zod schemas (30+ endpoints), Helm 19-service chart, Kong CI/CD jobs, design system 20 components, semantic diff + version page, canvas data layer hooks, dashboard grid layout, admin route group, Prisma ADR-013 migration plan, SSE typed event routing, AuthKit frontend component, audit export service + endpoint, versioned routes. **Partial:** Deno sandbox still executes via `child_process` subprocess (remains ❌); eval CI gate job added but `cd.yml` blocking enforcement not confirmed (remains 🟡). |
| 2026-07-04 | Full architecture compliance audit against v2.1. Matrix written. Typesense marked as ADR-010 violation. All CI/CD, checkpoint schema, lease-based execution, error envelope, AI guardrails, SSE multiplexing gaps recorded with accurate statuses. |
| 2026-07-05 | **Import audit — 14 parallel domain explorers.** Newly ✅: SagaCoordinator wired into DAGRunner (`finally`-block `runSagaCompensation`); approval escalation chain + 24h/1h reminders; child workflow `await:true` polling; child nesting depth cap (5) enforced; loop tier caps enforced; 3-attempt `recovery_exhausted` terminal state + DLQ routing; billing rollup + reconciliation jobs + queues; monthly partitioning DDL confirmed in migration SQL; per-queue AOF/RDB tuning; queue-depth HPA (BullMQ external metric); single multiplexed SSE `/api/v1/realtime` endpoint; `packages/shared-realtime` RealtimeHub; dashboard + notification SSE endpoints; `event_id` `evt_` prefix enforced in `createEvent()`; `workflow.rolled_back` underscore; input guardrails on streaming path; tool guardrails allow-list; Typesense removed (ADR-010 compliant); Redis cluster Terraform (3+3); runbooks at `docs/runbooks/`; MFA SMS via WorkOS; SCIM group→role mapping; README.md in all 19 services. Newly 🟡 (from ❌): `shared-testing`/`event-bus` packages exist as placeholders; Redis cluster Helm (no explicit toggle); OTel search-service (metrics only, no tracing). Newly ❌ (from 🟡): per-workflow 100K token ceiling confirmed not enforced in request lifecycle. **Remaining: 32 ❌ + 31 🟡 = 63 unique architecture compliance gaps.** |
